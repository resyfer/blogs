# resyfer's Dev Blog

Hi, I am Saurav Pal, and I code under the name `resyfer`. Here's a blog to share my two cents on stuff.

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic developer who's open to learning anything and everything related to operating systems, embedded systems, and networking, and I like open source.

I am a Google Summer of Code 2024 (GSoC '24') contributor to Apache organization in which I am working on [designing and implementing mnemofs, which is a filesystem for NAND Flashes for the Apache NuttX Real Time Operating System (RTOS)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/JISwnjR5).

I'm also currently an upcoming Associate Software Engineer at Oracle.

I was also a GSoC '23 contributor to PostgreSQL as well, working on [improving PostgreSQL version support for pgexporter](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2023/projects/Djrl5w5B).

I am currently a fresh graduate from the [National Institute of Technology, Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/), which is one of the [Institutions of National Importance in India](https://www.education.gov.in/institutions-national-importance), in which I was pursing a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) for 4 years (from Nov 2020 - May 2024).
