# Motherboard Chipsets and Memory Map

**NOTE**: This article is from 2008, close to the version 2.0 of UEFI.

This shows that the CPU doesn't really know what the outside world is. It just uses its pins to connect to the outside world without caring what it is.

The motherboard has a front-side bus that connects the CPU to the northbridge chip and indirectly connects to the other parts. This bus is used when it needs to read or write to memory. CPU and the outside world communicate through 3 ways:

- Memory address space
- I/O address space
- Interrupts

It uses the pins to specify the physical address it wants to read and write, and the data to be written or received. The Intel Core 2 shown in the diagram above has 33 pins for physical memory address and 64 pins to send or receive data.

Thus data is transmitted in a 64-bit data path, and the chip can technically handle a physical address space of maximum 64 GiB. Physical address is not just for RAM, though it primarily is. It is also used for memory-mapped I/O devices like video cards PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) cards like scanners or SCSI, and even the flash memory that stores the BIOS.

The northcard reads the physical memory location and decides where to route it to via its memory address map. The file /proc/iomem shows the memory locations (DEBUG: (2)).

This is the cause of the 3GB barrier(3) where 32-bit OSes are supposed to be compatible with 4 GB of memory, but that only refers to 4GB of physical memory space, not 4 GB RAM. There is a classic big hole in between around 640KB to 1MB and can be bigger due to video and PCI cards and often around the top 1 GB is mapped to devices. However, some had an extension to this.(4)

In my case, the first 4 MB are reserved (among some other sections) and is dependent on the motherboard and devices present. These are **physical** addresses that are used to write to the motherboard buses. Inside the CPU (like in the programs we write and run), the memory addresses are **logical** addresses, and need to be translated by the CPU to a physical address before accessing it through the bus.

There are two ways of accessing devices: memory-mapped I/O and port-mapped I/O. In memory-mapped I/O, you can continue using the same CPU instructions used to access main memory to access devices, and the motherboard will handle it for you. Port-mapped I/O requires special instructions from the CPU.(5)

## Memory Translation from Logical to Physical

The translation of logical memory addresses to physical memory addresses is complex as it depends on the CPU mode (**real mode**, 32-bit **protected mode**, 64-bit protected mode). This mode decides how much of the physical address space can be accessed.

### Real Mode
(6)
It's a 20-bit addressing mode that provides unlimited direct to all physical address. No support for memory protection, multi-tasking or code-privileges. Before Intel's 80286, real mode was the only mode available. Post that, protected mode became a thing. 20-bit means **1 MB** of address space.

### 64-bit Mode

A 64-bit mode can access memory wayyyyyyyyyyy larger than the current RAM sizes. Thus, it's possible to use the physical addresses **above** the total RAM to compensate for the physical address space lost to devices. This is called **reclaiming** the memory and **is done through help from the chipset**.
