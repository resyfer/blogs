# Mnemofs's Journal

Continuing a reoccuring theme, to understand this, we need to understand something else before. Since journal stores updated information about a file or a directory, first we need to look into how mnemofs stores a file or a directory.

## Count Trailing Zero (CTZ)

On a seemingly unrelated note, have you heard of the CTZ operation? It, as its name suggests, counts the number of trailing zeroes in the binary representation of a number.

eg. 1860 is ``11101000100`` in binary, and there are ``2`` trailing zeroes in it. Thus, ``ctz(1860) == 2``.

GNU compilers provide a ``__builtin_ctz(x)`` for this, and in C 23, it's become a part of the official standard. Most CPU architectures support this instruction.

## CTZ Skip List

A skip list is a modified singly linked list that, instead of containing one pointer per node to point to the next node, contain more pointers in **addition** to the original pointer. Also, as shown by [littlefs (who pioneered the CTZ skip list data structure)](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs/blob/master/DESIGN.md#ctz-skip-lists), Copy-On-Write benefits from a backward linked list (or a backward skip list) than a forward skip list.

Skip lists prefer to keep the number of pointers per node as random to lower the cost of insertion and deletion. However, a Copy-On-Write file system has no need of "insertion" and "deletion". All of the operations are of the form of "appending" and all modifications requested are done in memory. We'll discuss how a CTZ skip list works in mnemofs, but first we need to know what is the structure of a CTZ skip list.

In CTZ skip lists, each CTZ skip list block at index ``x`` has ``ctz(x) + 1`` number of pointers (0 for 0th CTZ skip list block). Each CTZ skip list block has pointer to ``(x - 2^i)``th CTZ skip list block for every ``i`` such that ``x`` is divisible by ``2^i``. For example, CTZ skip list block with index ``6`` will have pointers to ``5``th and ``4``th CTZ skip list blocks, while CTZ skip list block with index ``8`` will have pointers to ``7``th, ``6``th, ``4``th and ``0``th CTZ skip list blocks.

In mnemofs, each CTZ skip list block takes exactly one page of space.

Since it's possible to iterate to any CTZ skip list block from the very last CTZ skip list block, only the page number and index of the last CTZ skip list block is stored, along with the size of the file. Mnemofs uses CTZ skip lists like its creator, littefs, does. However, mnemofs uses it to represent files **and** directories.

## Journal Logs

Back to the journal, now, once the updated information of the CTZ skip list is received, it is logged to the journal along with a CTZ skip list representation of the path of the FS object. This log is followed by a checksum to make sure that the entire log was written correctly to the flash.

## Structure

The journal consists of blocks from the NAND flash. The last two blocks allocated for the journal are reserved for the master node, and are called master blocks (more on that later). The first block starts with an 8 byte magic sequence, followed by the number of blocks (all ``n + 2`` blocks) allocated to the journal, and then an array that contains the block numbers of all the blocks allocated to the journal.

This is like a modified version of a singly linked list. A traidional singly linked list design was not used to allow the mount process to quickly find the master node once the journal was found (more on that later), and it reduces space, as a traidional design would require the last page of every block in the journal to be reserved specifically for storing the block number of the next block.

The first ``n`` blocks (out of the ``n + 2`` blocks) store the logs, and once full, the journal gets flushed, but more on that later.

## Conclusion

So, this is how the journal works, and the "more on that later" parts will be explained in the next section that discusses the master node of mnemofs.
