# mnemofs

Mnemofs is a NAND Flash File System designed and built for NuttX as part of the [Google Summer of Code 2024 program](https://lists.apache.org/thread/vnlyzosgp3rbc9jqf64np126rjhntmrq). Mnemofs is designed to be a middle ground between flash storage consumption, memory consumption, wear and speed. It sacrifices a little bit of everything, and ends up being acceptably good in all of them, instead of sacrificing multiple aspects, and being good in one.

mnemofs consists of several components, and thus, we approach it one by one. Baby steps.
